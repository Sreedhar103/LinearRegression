# Bike Sharing System (Linear Regression Assignment)
> A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
  It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
  This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system

## General Information
- The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
 It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
 They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
 Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market



## Conclusions
 - r2_score on test data is 80.9 and R square values on the model is 83.2. Since the difference is very less we can say this is a good model.

 -  With the R2 values we can conclude there is no overfit or underfit of the model

 - temperature,year,winter,september are positively correlated means with increase in this(or during these periods) the bike rentals also increase

 -  windspeed,spring,Monday,july,light rain and cloudy are negatively correlated means with increase in this(or during these periods) the bike rentals decrease


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
